**This page is under massive construction. I am not Einstein.**

I get excited about the intersection of science and real world problems.

I'm a multidisciplinary researcher, having worked in basic neuroscience at [York University](https://mri.info.yorku.ca/), psychiatry at [CAMH](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research), radiology with [Imagia](https://imagia.com/), finance with the [CDPQ](https://www.cdpq.com/en), applied machine learning research with [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), user engagement with [Google](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/google-calls-its-smart-ad-relevance-system-smart-ass-yes-seriously/)
and RNA biology with [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/).

As I learn more about science, find myself compelled to explore new fields and build bridges between disciplines. For me, science is only a piece of the puzzle, and I'm facinated by all of the steps required to bring a prototype into production. You can see the scope of my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jd7wEJ8AAAAJ&hl=en) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephdviviano/), or check out my [resume](https://github.com/josephdviviano/resume/raw/master/jdv-resume.pdf).

Long term, I'm most interested in use of AI to power new scientific breakthroughs, and particularly to discover new technologies to fight climate change, improve food security, and to power continued growth of the economy without compromising the sustainability of our planet.

I'm also an amateur photographer and musician, and I've peppered some of my work throughout the site. You can check out my

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
